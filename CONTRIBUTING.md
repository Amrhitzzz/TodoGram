# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a
couple of hurdles.

*   Do not use any unauthorised source codes,
*   Feel free to PR even if the patch is very small,

## Contributing A Patch

1.  Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the
    [issue tracker](https://github.com/CodewithSudeep/TodoGram/issues).
2.  If you want to make a change that doesn't
    have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
3.  Also, coordinate with team members that are listed on the issue in question.
    This ensures that work isn't being duplicated and communicating your plan
    early also generally leads to better patches.
4.  Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. 
5.  Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which
    you are contributing.
6.  Submit a pull request.

## CodewithSudeep Community

You are definitely encouraged to contribute to the discussion and you can also help us
to keep the effectiveness of the group high by following and promoting the
guidelines listed here.

### Please Be Friendly

Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the CodewithSudeep's culture,
and we strongly encourage everyone participating in joining us in accepting nothing less. 
Of course, being courteous is not the same as
failing to constructively disagree with each other, but it does mean that we
should be respectful of each other when enumerating the 42 technical reasons
that a particular proposal may not be the best choice. There's never a reason to
be antagonistic or dismissive toward anyone who is sincerely trying to
contribute to a discussion.
You don't have to actually submit code in order to sign up. Your participation
itself is a valuable contribution.

## Developing TodoGram

This section discusses how to make your own changes to the Application.

### Building TodoGram

To make sure your changes work as intended and don't break existing
functionality, you'll want to clone/fork and run. For that you can use:

    git clone https://github.com/CodewithSudeep/TodoGram.git
    cd TodoGram
    npm install

Make sure you have Node.js installed, as TodoGram is written
in React.js.

To build the app at last, do

    npm run build

Now the build should pass.
